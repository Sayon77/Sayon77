👋 Hi, I’m Sayon Haldar (@Sayon77)
👀 I’m driven to build efficient backend systems with Python and explore AI to power smart applications.
🌱 I’m starting my backend journey on Day 1 of Code with Harry’s 100 Days of Code (April 16, 2025), committing 2 hours daily and 6 hours Sundays to master Flask, PostgreSQL, and AI APIs in 3 months. Currently tackling Python basics; next steps: a to-do list REST API (Month 1) and an AI-driven weather API integration (Month 3). My Diploma and B.Tech in Electronics and Communication Engineering sharpen my skills in debugging and system efficiency.
💞️ I’m excited to contribute to beginner-friendly open-source projects on Flask, APIs, or AI backends. Let’s code and grow together!

😄 Pronouns: He/Him⚡ Fun fact: By day, I fix laptops as a repair engineer; by night, I’m coding my way to backend mastery, one debug at a time!
